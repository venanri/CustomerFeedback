I told him no, told him to close the call, I'm going to bed.

Last Fall, I dropped STB and DVR service, buying a HDHomeRun Prime, and investing in a Mac Mini (running Windows 8.1 with WMC), paying $5 / month to rent the cable card. My 2 year agreement expired in Dec., where my bill jumped because I no longer received any discounts.The monthly bill avg jumped from $125+ to  $150+ (with taxes and fees).Two weeks ago, I called to cancel service -- but a representative convinced me to stay with VZ, and signed me up as a new customer, which would include $350 Visa prepaid card; he arranged to have my existing service cut off the day before my installation date.Initially, the installation order was for Extreme HD, 50/50, Voice, 12 mo free Entertainment Package: $109.99.I did more research afterwards and looked into the Custom TV package -- given we're not big sports watchers.The next day, I spoke with a representative who was extremely helpful (probably one of the best) who offered to look into all the options to lower my bill, even seeing if the $350 Visa prepaid was worthwhile -- to avoid having me locked into a contract, etc. Changed the order to Custom TV, 50/50, Voice, 12 mo free Entertainment Package: $79.99 (which includes a $20/mo existing FIOS ready discount). The rep even sent a couple of follow-up emails to specify installation, activation fees would be waived; in addition, I would receive the $350 Visa prepaid gift card.After installation, we decided we didn't like the 2 free Channel Packs, and tried to change 1 of the packs for another. For some reason, My Verizon portal is incredibly slow ... and somehow, inadvertently changed Internet to 25/25.Called in to ask for help...another representative then helped to place a 'new order,' but offered Triple Play with 75/75 with Free Quantum router: $99 but would receive $15 'Valued Customer credit'/mo for 12 months making the bundle $85.99 for first 12 months -- though it's very questionable on whether he baked in the cost of the router. This representative was shady when I requested for him to send a written email with how the first bill - ensuring I wouldn't be charged installation, activation fees. But he gave lame excuse that they're not able to send individual emails, but assured me I would keep existing discounts, and any other promotions already offered. A few hours later, I received an automated email with Preview of the order. The first monthly bill was $180 !!!!! It included being charged for Quantum router ... installation, activation fees.Unfortunately my bill does not cut for another 2 days, so I still don't know what the first bill will look like. In addition, when I log into my account, it shows I've paid for the Quantum Router, and my Bundle Price is $89.99.TLDR: for 'cord cutters': does the Custom TV plan seem worthwhile? VZ definitely did their homework & split off the channels that we watch into 3 channel packs.I looked at different service options... If I drop to 50/50, and change to Extreme TV, the monthly Triple Play with 'retain current agreement' price is $99.99. However, I assume w/ taxes and fees especially with the $4.99 sports fee, this will be around $120... Or am I better off, dropping to 50/50 and adding another Channel Pack?Separately, ever since EPG and other changes, we are having issues with audio drops (PC connected to AVR via HDMI). And with Windows 10...need to look at other options for watching / recording TV."12,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","NBA League Pass Single Game Packages","matcarl","16","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30169540-Nick-Toons-HD-added-VH07","2015-Jun-17 5:56 am","POSTIVE","POSTIVE",""13,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","Nick Toons HD added VH07?","bsangs","31","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30191409-NEWS-Verizon-Gives-Employees-App-to-Record-Bad-Union-Behavior","2015-Jul-13 6:33 pm","POSTIVE","POSTIVE","Live on channel 754.

I am getting just the digital adapter, which is being offered for free (at least for now, at least for new subscribers). My understanding is that this will allow me to all the channels I am subscribed to, minus HD versions, minus interactive features.I also understand that you can also just plug a TV direct to coax outlet without any box, and if TV has QAM decoder, can at least get local channels, including HD, much like over the air digital signal (except, hopefully better, since I don't get very good reception with my antenna now).My question is, do the local channels coming in from the digital adapter include HD versions, or all those SD too?  If only SD, then I imagine what I will want to do is to split the signal, and connect one directly to the TV coax for purposes of getting HD local channels, and then connect the other through the digital adapter box to get all the other channels, via RCA cables or S-video or whatever alternate connectors the box allows.Does that sound right?thanks."21,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","[NEWS] Strike Looms as Verizon, Union Negotiations Struggle"," </p","2","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30187683-NEWS-Fox-is-Locking-Down-TiVO-Content-on-Verizon-FiOS","2015-Jul-22 5:46 pm","NEUTRAL","POSTIVE"," - posted on the home page"22,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","[NEWS] Fox is Locking Down TiVO Content on Verizon FiOS"," </p","2","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30186894-QIP-7100-2-does-a-screen-saver-I-don-t-want","2015-Jul-22 4:58 pm","NEUTRAL","NEGATIVE"," - posted on the home page"23,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","QIP 7100-2 does a 'screen saver' I don't want","tkurkowski6","4","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30185218-Guide-Potential-new-guide","2015-Jul-22 10:52 am","NEUTRAL","NEGATIVE","In the middle of watching a program it blacks out the screen and displays a 'Click Menu' dialog.

My router is downstairs next to my verizon fios server.  My TV works fine there.  However, in my bedroom, the signal is not that strong (both internet and TV).  My client upstairs cannot find a MOCA connection.Previously, I had 2 DVRs one downstairs and one in the bedroom.  TV worked fine in both areas although the bedroom signal was a little weak and I had issues getting on demand to work every once in a while.  I recently upgraded to quantum fios and they gave me a new rev i router (upgraded from rev e) and and a client and server DVR setup.  I installed the router first.  Once I installed the router, my DVR upstairs stopped working.  Then I installed the client and server.  The server installed fine since it resides downstairs right next to router.  But as I mentioned, the client never worked.So I'm considering purchasing this network extender for $75 from verizon.  I don't want to have verizon repair guy come in and staple this invasive coax cable from downstairs to upstairs, so this wireless device would be acceptable.Anyway, does anyone have this device and is it helpful?  I'd like it to help for TV and Internet purposes.  Also, would it be possible to get another device from a third party that can do this perhaps at a cheaper price?  Or can I purchase one of these from lets say eBay and install it without an issue?

It said it activated ok.  Immediately realized I was missing most of the channels, so I tried calling, got the phone tree and agreed to an automated re-hit for my cards.  This is where everything went south, instead of fixing the new cablecard, I lost most of the channels on all three cards.  After several hours going back and forth between billing and tech support, it was determined that the guy who did the last cable card also put in a future order for an upgrade to the Extreme package, which was wrong because I never asked or approved of it, plus apparently he incorrectly entered the information resulting in most of the channels being dropped out.  Then they tried to remove this pending upgrade and eventually did so with great difficulty for whatever reason, however several attempts to re-pair the cable cards have failed and after going back and forth for most of today, the only remedy suggested was to send  a tech out tomorrow.  The problem is that I am virtually certain that this is still some kind of rare account issue that was not cleared even though they eventually got that upgrade removed and I am pretty sure the tech won't be able to do anything either.

Called again today and said I was going to disconnect and was told they have discretion for $10/mo 24 month term discount.  Still not really enough with my service going up almost $30.  They tell me that I'm already getting a good discount for the free dvr, so they can't add any other discounts.  The free dvr for life promo isn't much of a promo then if it's preventing me from them giving me discounts I could otherwise get.If I place an order with Cablevision and they see a port order in the system for my phone number, will they then likely offer me something better when I call in to cancel?Also, what's the deal with the updated TV Extreme package?

Before I do that, I have a few questions that hopefully can be answered.  I currently have FIOS Quantum DVR service plus two mini boxes.  I currently pay $27.99 for FIOS equipment and $22.00 for the Enhanced Service.  If I buy a TIVO DVR plus 2 minis, would I not have to pay the FIOS equipment fee and the Enhanced Service fee? If true, this will save me $50 a month.  From what I can tell, I would have to rent a Cablecard from Verizon that would have to be inserted into the TIVO DVR.  I was quoted a price of $4.99 a month.  From what I can tell, Cablecards are not required for the TIVO minis.  As for the TIVO costs, I would pay $14.99 per month or $149 for the year.  Am I right to assume this covers all the TIVO equipment (DVR and minis)?  A couple more questions........ 1) will I still have the ability to use On Demand? and 2) how difficult is the installation?

I have that same package and have always had both, for some reason she, living just some few miles away didn't. The offer said the cost would not change.And the cost of the package didn't.But her bill just came and now, for the first time, it includes the Regional Sports Network Fee. OK, I know everyone is supposed to pay it whether they watch sports or not.So why didn't she have it billed till now? Nothing changed except she lost a channel or two and gained HBO, Showtime and six months free (unrequested) of EPIX.And even of more importance, has it gone up to $9.98 a month?

I live in VHO8. I believe it started this morning after receiving the latest update. If I enter channel 10,  it auto tunes to channel 510. That's fine. If I channel up it goes to channel 502 which is my first channel in my favorites. If I channel down it goes to channel 931 which is my last channel in my favorites. Something is wrong with auto tune. If I enter the whole channel number 510, it works correctly by going to the next channel number in my favorites. Not sure if I have something wrong in my setup or it just a bug with the new software.

I was poking around On Demand and noticed that none of the programs have 'expiration' dates -- the 'available until' dates. I checked a lot of different channels/programs, and not one single program had a date. And some of the programs I watch have a very short shelf life, like 7 days, so I have to monitor the dates to make sure I don't miss them before they disappear from OD.To clarify, with my old non-Quantum STBs, OD programs showed expiration dates. I realize that some programs don't show dates at all, or don't show dates until they're close to expiring, but, for a specific example, I'm talking about channels like FXX -- I watch In Living Color and FXX has always shown the expiration dates.Another, much more annoying issue, is that the STBs (whatever Quantum boxes are called -- we have one main box, and one smaller box on a second TV) have, in the space of about 12 hours, gone into the screensaver ('press menu to watch TV) mode all by themselves. It happened once when the TVs were turned off, but also happened while the TV was on and I was watching a movie.Is there a way to fix either issue? I poked around in the settings, but didn't find anything relevant. I found a thread in this forum that listed the specs for the latest system update, and I believe I do have the newest version.TIA."92,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","[NEWS] Verizon Hopes Nobody Will Notice It No Longer Wants DSL Users"," </p","2","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30104067-MLB-Strike-Zone-Channel","2015-Jun-12 2:03 pm","NEUTRAL","POSTIVE"," - posted on the home page"93,"Forums> &rarr; <A HREF='/forums/54'> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Verizon FiOS TV","MLB Strike Zone Channel","skohly","10","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30068520-Channel-Repositioning-July-20th","2015-Jun-9 7:46 pm","POSTIVE","POSTIVE","Perhaps I have missed this but tonight I discovered on Ch 834 the MLB Strike Zone Channel which broadcasts Tuesday and Friday nights.

I know that channels come and channels go. They do it all the time. So why do I need to 'upgrade' to the most current version of my plan? Doesn't that happen automatically?I understand if they would cancel this plan and start up a new plan, hence that would 'grandfather' me in my old plan and they want me to switch.
