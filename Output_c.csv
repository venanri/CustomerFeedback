Each DVR has 2 HD tuners and each has a 500GB internal HDD.  The guide isn't fancy, but it works.When X1 first came out, there were all kinds of issues posted and users did not seem satisfied and upgrading didn't seem like a good idea.  Fast forward a couple of years, and I'm wondering if it's time to revisit an upgrade.I've done some research on the Comcast forum and tried to read up as much as I can, but I'm looking for candid, boiled down feedback.  Is an upgrade to X1 from legacy digital boxes/DVRs recommended or should I continue to hold tight?   What are the main drawbacks or missing features in X1 today?

Combined with the no FF this is really annoying.- recorded shows periodically record with 'static'- the DVR is generally laggy and slow to respond, leading to unintentional button pushes when you think your original selection wasn't received and you reenter it, only to have the DVR simultaneously receive and execute both selections, particularly when navigating menusCan anyone provide some comparative info with the XFINITY service?

This was going to be the case for standard HD boxes and HD-DTA's. The location is in a suburb of Detroit.Back a few years ago, I had a connection at Comcast that originally gave me the news that they would be reorganizing the channels between 100 & 999, and then also adding 1000 to those for HD. Not having done less than 1000 reorg, at least as yet, it looks like the solution now is to simply duplicate the all HD channels over 1000 (already done) and eliminate the 3 digit HD channels.From the 1000+ lineups I've seen across the country, they all appear to have the same channels on the same numbers, e.g:1070 HSN1105 FOX News1204 A&E1305 Lifetime1405 MTV1507 Sprout1605 ESPN1705 NFL Network1806 AMC1910 HBOThis pretty much aligns with the info from years ago:- 1000's: Locals, shopping- 1100's: News, government, weather- 1200's & 1300's: General entertainment and lifestyle cable channels- 1400's: Music channels- 1500's: Kids and religious channels- 1600's & 1700's: Sports channels- 1800's: Movie channels and PPV- 1900's: Premium channelsHas anyone else heard about eliminating the 3 digit HD channel numbers?"Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

This is for the Digital Starter (no premium channels) Voice, and Internet. One DTA, and 3 cable cards.Verizon triple is $80/mo, and I expect an extra $15 for the 3 cards. So about $100 for 2 yr commitment, and a $350 rebate gift card. It seems to me that competition would make the cost between these two choices a lot closer. The only reason I hesitate to just flip the switch is the pain to set up new email accounts. (If I had any words of wisdom for young people it would be to never set up email tied to your provider.)So my question is this - When I call Comcast, are they going to offer a compromise?

One TV is on a converter box; the other is on a dta.  Both are SD , but both TVs can support HD connections.Prior to Comcast we had digital converters on inside antennas.   Reception was not very good - the picture often froze or broke up - but the picture quality was good.  Now the reception is consistent, but the picture quality - particularly on the dta - is poor.  The biggest problem is 'ghosts'.  Since that is an analog problem it must be in the cable connection between the box and the TV (or in the box itself).So - finally - my questions:Is this an upgrade to the service contract, or just an upgrade of equipment?Can we upgrade just the dta, or must we upgrade both?How expensive is this upgrade?  I assume the cost varies by location.  I live in Seattle, WA.And the most puzzling question:  Are the answers to these questions on the Comcast web site?  I can't find anything about upgrading from SD to HD there.  I would think Comcast would eagerly tell customers how to give them more money."Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

So, my wife and I have to make the ride up to his house and see what is going on. Low and behold, to take advantage of some door to door salesmonkey's pitch about lower prices with Comcast, he switches.Now, my father in law has no computer in the house so he goes just for phone and video. Well, they hook up the video alright but not the phone.  So, I call customer service and they test the phone and it rings and rings until it hits voicemail.  Then, come to find out, the gateway has a phone jack in the back and I get and old phone to plug in and that works.  It seems the contracting crew did not hook up the phone line.  If they would have placed the equipment in the same place that the FIOS equipment was, there would be none of this problem. But, in an attempt to save time, they caused a second truck roll AND cost Comcast a bit more money and a loss of confidence. They are due back this morning to try and fix the issue which is important since there is a Life Alert system in the house. And if anyone from Comcast says that you shouldn't use a Comcast landline for important functions, then your service should not be sold to the public as a land line replacement.On a side note, while talking to the Comcast CSR, I mentioned to my wife and father in law how the contractor that did this was beyond incompetent.  He heard me and agreed with me telling me that the contractors are committing so many mistakes, that he gets calls constantly about their screwups.If Comcast wants to better its reputation, they better not only clean up their CSR staff but either hire some better contractors or make installation an in house item.

Some crews came out the following several days and marked the utilities as required by law.  The last one came on 5/14(ironically enough he was marking the cable lines) and as I got home from work I was able to talk to him.  When I told him about the sprinkler system he went on his computer and gave me the phone # of the subcontractor that would be doing the actual digging.  I got ahold of this person/company the next morning and inquired about their job to bury the drop at my address.  I was told that they would be doing in in the next 10 business days.  I then told/warned them that there was an underground sprinkler system, and was told OK I will make a note of that on your work order, thanks for letting us know.Fast forward to today and I came home from work and found the drop was indeed buried.  Tested out the sprinkler system briefly, sure enough one of the lines is ruptured as a couple of the heads don't come up and there was a spot on the lawn that turned to a swampy mess, indicative of a ruptured line underground.Should I contact the subcontractor?  Comcast doesn't have a phone option for 'property damage'  I want a professional sprinkler installer(I have the installer from the previous owner) to fix it right and I want either Comcast or the subcontractor to pay for it.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated for this new homeowner headache.

I already have the double play package with tv and internet so I am simply swapping out my old boxes with the new ones. My question is since the tech is just setting up the boxes and possibly the MOCA filter I keep hearing about then do they need to mess with my internet at all? I am asking because every time they do it always seems to get messed up and I need it more than ever now for work. Does the X1 box need to connect to my modem? Can it be wireless or does it have to directly connect with an ethernet cable? Also, does anyone know how long this will take? What does the process involve? I already have 3 cable outlets ready and working for them to use so I don't expect any wiring. I'm also in an apartment so I don't know if whatever they do make it more difficult.

My Netflix, Gamefly, Hulu etc etc already keeps me busy enough....but i cant get a reliable OTA signal @ my new apartment. So Im forced to look for a cheap, contract free option to get my local channels.Thats why Im interested in the TV Latino 150 package. Only $20 a month for 70+ english channels sounds ok (I'll ignore the spanish stuff) until other options becomes available (ex. SlingTV adding local channels)Thanks in advance for the help."Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

I have one main DVR/main unit, 1 secondary unit, and, as it turns out, a swap-out of my Arris modem for this TV/Internet package.Long story short: Main connections are great. Older cable run for upstairs secondary box won't connect.I brought the remote box down to the source and it worked fine so I have a starting point.My plan, since I don't have any test equipment at all, is to grab a 100-foot cable I have installed (no longer in use) and run that up from my source to the remote box and ensure it works that way, then I guess I'll have to do a real cable run outside the house if this test works.My setup is filtered source from Comcast to a PCT-MA2-4P amplifier with direct connections from there to the Arris, and the main X1 unit. The other two outputs connect with the older house cabling (which goes into the walls at the point where a remodel was done years ago). I really don't think there is a splitter anywhere in the lines I'm using, but without a signal meter I'll never be sure - I didn't do the remodel.Otherwise, self install has been excellent! If I had not seen others' posts about bad/imperfect cabling I might have been frustrated by the remote box problem.I guess my only question in all of this is that if I had paid for installation, would it have covered installing a new cable run to the desired location?"Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment
