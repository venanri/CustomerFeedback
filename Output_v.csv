Even with very good signal strength I get the dreaded 771-Signal Loss every time there is a heavy rain in my area.So what I'd like to know is what should I ask for equipment-wise when ordering the system? Is there a specific model Modem, DVR or satellite box that I should try and get that offer the best user experience?Also, I currently have Xfinity internet and VoIP. I assume I will be getting a different modem. Should I buy one instead? I don't need the WiFi router combo unit since I would like to continue to use my Apple Airport Express for my home WiFi.Really appreciate any responses so I can move forward in making a good decision and install. Thanks!"3,"Forums> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Comcast Cable TV>[Content] NJ- WJLP (MeTV affiliate) coming on 9/3!","</div"," </p","7","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30195150-Bill-Bill-increase-by-10","2015-Jul-18 2:43 am","POSTIVE","POSTIVE","The year+ long wait is over.

My bill was formerly $122 for the Starter XF bundle (with added on 1yr Blast promo as an apology for 3 months of horrible service) with an X1 DVR, Modem Rental, and 1 DTA. Comcast had promised be a $0 rental fee for the DVR box for the duration of the promo (1 year). They also waived the nonsense HD Tech fee after I complained about it being absolute nonsense in 2015.Well, lo and behold, I am now getting the $10 fee for 'Anyroom DVR' on my bill. Note its just a 1 room X1 setup, no sub-boxes present.Any way I can get Comcast to put things back to the way they were? $122 is the sweet spot for my cable bill. $10 for a box rental is high. 1-800 is useless and will probably mess up the account even more than it could help.

We currently have FiOS multi-DVR service, and have noticed the following problems:- you usually can't FF in On Demand- if you pause On Demand for longer than a minute or so it will completely time out and you can only resume play from the start of the program, not where you paused. Combined with the no FF this is really annoying.- recorded shows periodically record with 'static'- the DVR is generally laggy and slow to respond, leading to unintentional button pushes when you think your original selection wasn't received and you reenter it, only to have the DVR simultaneously receive and execute both selections, particularly when navigating menusCan anyone provide some comparative info with the XFINITY service? How are the latest DVRs? Does On Demand work well?Thanks in advance for any info."20,"Forums> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Comcast Cable TV>[Content] Guide change with lost channels","</div","gaforces","9","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30148122-Content-Weather-Channel-no-longer-in-HD-in-Atlanta","2015-Jul-11 9:18 pm","POSTIVE","POSTIVE",""21,"Forums> &rarr; <h1 style='display:inline;'>Comcast Cable TV>[Content] Weather Channel no longer in HD in Atlanta","</div","GTFan","11","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30169555-X1-X2-Channel-listings-incorrect","2015-Jul-2 10:38 am","NEUTRAL","POSTIVE","Does anyone know why TWC HD channel is no longer HD in Atlanta on Comcast?

If I haven't watched a channel for a while, 30-60 mins, when I change to it, I will ALWAYS see Ads. The beginning of the Ad block a solid 3-4 or more minutes. Has anyone else seen this? I read a post from October 2013 from someone in FL. he was shot down for the most part but it is happening. I'm am so tired of Ads, I rarely watch a show that I've not recorded. And the iPad phone browsing, even worse. This amount of advertising has to be more annoying than profitably, well I'm guessing they don't care if it annoys. "
