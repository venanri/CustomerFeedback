I have ultimate so I called Verizon and my cable cards had to be reactivated but now Fox networks are showing the copyright flag. I have 5 HTPC in my house with HD Homerun Prime Tuners. I use 1 primary PC as the DVR and I watch non protected content over the network. I am fully aware that HBO and Max have copyright flags and will not allow playback on a machine that it was not recorded on but now Fox News and Fox Business are showing the same error?? What gives, did Verizon now add the copyright flag??!!!"2,"Forums>US Telco Support>Verizon>Verizon FiOS TV","</h1"," </p","31","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30200197-FiOS-Mobile-App-not-working-Sort-of","2015-Jul-28 11:14 am","POSTIVE","POSTIVE","On July 31st Accuweather will launch a region specific dedicated channel.

So, My wife has been watching Bravo on her iPad using FiOS Mobile app here at home (Philly Suburbs) and within the last two weeks or so the App has stopped giving her access to it and she now gets a message at the top of the screen that reads: 'Connect to your in home FiOS Wi-Fi network for more channels' which she never got before.  Does anyone know of any changes that would have caused this??I am not using the FiOS router as I only have local TV service at this residence (no cable boxes) with internet and telephone.  So I am guessing not using the FiOS router is the issue, however it has been working for the last year or more with my current setup and the app says it was last updated in May and my wife tells me it had been working since that last update...  So, I am a bit baffled.  Thought I would ask here before firing up wireshark to see if I can tell what it is doing..."4,"Forums>US Telco Support>Verizon>Verizon FiOS TV","</h1"," </p","2","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30087549-Channels-Buzzr-To-Replace-Bounce-in-VHO5","2015-Jul-29 2:30 pm","NEUTRAL","POSTIVE"," - posted on the home page"5,"Forums>US Telco Support>Verizon>Verizon FiOS TV","</h1","charliewatts","12","http://www.dslreports.com//forum/r30200437-NEWS-Verizon-Now-Selling-HBO-Now","2015-Jun-1 12:05 pm","POSTIVE","POSTIVE","Buzzr, a digital sub channel airing game shows, is scheduled to launch today, 6/1/15.
