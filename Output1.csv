It said it activated ok.  Immediately realized I was missing most of the channels, so I tried calling, got the phone tree and agreed to an automated re-hit for my cards.  This is where everything went south, instead of fixing the new cablecard, I lost most of the channels on all three cards.  After several hours going back and forth between billing and tech support, it was determined that the guy who did the last cable card also put in a future order for an upgrade to the Extreme package, which was wrong because I never asked or approved of it, plus apparently he incorrectly entered the information resulting in most of the channels being dropped out.  Then they tried to remove this pending upgrade and eventually did so with great difficulty for whatever reason, however several attempts to re-pair the cable cards have failed and after going back and forth for most of today, the only remedy suggested was to send  a tech out tomorrow.  The problem is that I am virtually certain that this is still some kind of rare account issue that was not cleared even though they eventually got that upgrade removed and I am pretty sure the tech won't be able to do anything either.  I tried the Direct forum too, but once a tech visit is scheduled....they are not interested."Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

They tell me that I'm already getting a good discount for the free dvr, so they can't add any other discounts.  The free dvr for life promo isn't much of a promo then if it's preventing me from them giving me discounts I could otherwise get.If I place an order with Cablevision and they see a port order in the system for my phone number, will they then likely offer me something better when I call in to cancel?Also, what's the deal with the updated TV Extreme package?

Before I do that, I have a few questions that hopefully can be answered.  I currently have FIOS Quantum DVR service plus two mini boxes.  I currently pay $27.99 for FIOS equipment and $22.00 for the Enhanced Service.  If I buy a TIVO DVR plus 2 minis, would I not have to pay the FIOS equipment fee and the Enhanced Service fee? If true, this will save me $50 a month.  From what I can tell, I would have to rent a Cablecard from Verizon that would have to be inserted into the TIVO DVR.  I was quoted a price of $4.99 a month.  From what I can tell, Cablecards are not required for the TIVO minis.  As for the TIVO costs, I would pay $14.99 per month or $149 for the year.  Am I right to assume this covers all the TIVO equipment (DVR and minis)?  A couple more questions........ 1) will I still have the ability to use On Demand? and 2) how difficult is the installation?

I upgraded to quantum with a new router, rev I, and a client/server dvr setup.  First I installed the router.  The router is right in the family room next to the dvr.When I installed the new router, the dvr in the family room worked fine but the master bedroom dvr never connected to the new router.  A week later, I installed the new client/server.  The server is installed right next to the router and has a coaxial connector.  I have a splitter with one coax going to router and the other going to server.The client in the master bedroom, like the previous dvr, could not get a moca connection.  So my main coax cable is split also.  It goes to the master bedroom and the other goes to the family room.  The coax signal to the master bedroom always was weak.  I had issues getting on demand sometimes although it worked once in awhile.  Also a few had channels did not work perfectly.So I do not want to call verizon and have a tech come in and staple a coax cable from my basement to my upstairs.  The current cable runs from my basement to the outside of the house up to the second floor into the master bedroom, so it is not very invasive.  The coax connectors are pristine.I was wondering if there was another way to get a better TV connection similar to a power line adapter with an Ethernet connection but instead a coax connection. Or perhaps I can buy another mi424wr router and bridge it?  Any help would be appreciated."Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

I was poking around On Demand and noticed that none of the programs have 'expiration' dates -- the 'available until' dates. I checked a lot of different channels/programs, and not one single program had a date. And some of the programs I watch have a very short shelf life, like 7 days, so I have to monitor the dates to make sure I don't miss them before they disappear from OD.To clarify, with my old non-Quantum STBs, OD programs showed expiration dates. I realize that some programs don't show dates at all, or don't show dates until they're close to expiring, but, for a specific example, I'm talking about channels like FXX -- I watch In Living Color and FXX has always shown the expiration dates.Another, much more annoying issue, is that the STBs (whatever Quantum boxes are called -- we have one main box, and one smaller box on a second TV) have, in the space of about 12 hours, gone into the screensaver ('press menu to watch TV) mode all by themselves. It happened once when the TVs were turned off, but also happened while the TV was on and I was watching a movie.Is there a way to fix either issue? I poked around in the settings, but didn't find anything relevant. I found a thread in this forum that listed the specs for the latest system update, and I believe I do have the newest version.TIA."Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

So far, so good.I received an E-mail from Verizon today suggesting that I either upgrade to the most recent version of my plan, or upgrade to Ultimate HD.Why do I need to upgrade to the most recent version of my plan? I know that channels come and channels go. They do it all the time. So why do I need to 'upgrade' to the most current version of my plan? Doesn't that happen automatically?I understand if they would cancel this plan and start up a new plan, hence that would 'grandfather' me in my old plan and they want me to switch. But that's not what it sounds like. It just sounds like it's the same plan under the same name. Color me confused on this one.

Yes, they can see each other and their respective recordings, but I cannot record past 6 shows per dvr.  I would have to go to the other room and set up that dvr for recording.Watching the ad's for 'record up to 12 shows and 2 TB of space' I guess I was expecting one big dvr box to do this, or be able to do all of this recording from one quide.Even choosing a 'record a series with options', you would think that a option would be, 'living room' or 'family room' dvr.So do I have something not working correctly or what I thought premium service would do according to verizon's ad, it just cannot do.Thanks!!"Index,Forum,Title,AuthorName,TotalComments,NextLink,PostedTimeon,Comment

However when I received the confirmation email, it shows the price as 94.99. There is no mention of the $20 monthly discount. Uh oh.Researching Fios in forums I found that this is a fairly common practice - that Fios will often neglect to apply the agreed upon discount to a customers bill.Question: Anyone know how long the grace period is for canceling a FIOS contract.
